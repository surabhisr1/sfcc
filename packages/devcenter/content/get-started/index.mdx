Kickstart your Mobify Platform project with this complete guide. Install required software and dependencies and run your project locally for the first time!

<Callout type="warning">

**Important:** Our installation instructions have been updated to reflect many new technologies released starting in November 2018.
If you need to install a project that was generated _before_ November 2018, you can still access the [old Quick Start](resources/quick-start) guide.

Before you start development, you’ll need to install the following software on
any computers you plan to use for development:

Start by downloading and installing **Node 12.0.0**:

-   [Download the installer for 64-bit machines](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v12.0.0/node-v12.0.0-x64.msi)
-   [Download the installer for 32-bit machines](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v12.0.0/node-v12.0.0-x86.msi)
-   Run the installer and complete the setup instructions
-   When prompted by the installer, accept the default option to also install the Node.js runtime, install Node Package Manager, and add the Node.js runtime to your path

Install **Node Package Manager 6.11.3**:

-   Open the Windows Command Prompt and run `npm install -g npm@6.11.3`

Verify that the correct version of Node and Node Package Manager have been installed:

-   Open the Windows Command Prompt and run `node -v`
-   It should return `v12.0.0`
-   Run `npm -v`
-   It should return `6.11.3`

<p>
    <small>
        Our platform currently supports versions ^10.17.0 and ^12.0.0, whenever possible we recommend
        using the more recent version of the two. Other versions of Node are not supported and may result
        in unexpected errors once your project is deployed.
    </small>
</p>

<p>
    <small>For best results, we do _not_ recommend using Corey Butler's Node Version Manager (nvm) for Windows. In our testing, installations are more often successful by installing Node directly.</small>

Start by downloading and installing **Node 12.0.0**:

Verify that the correct version of Node and Node Package Manager have been installed:

-   Open your terminal app and run `node -v`
-   It should return `v12.0.0`

Start by downloading and installing **Node 12.0.0**:

-   Go to the [main download page](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v12.0.0/)
-   Download the right binary for your machine. (For example, if you have a 64-bit Intel machine, you would choose the x64 file.)
-   Extract the binaries and complete the setup instructions after downloading

Verify that the correct version of Node and Node Package Manager have been installed:

-   Open your terminal and run `node -v`
-   It should return `v12.0.0`
-   Run `npm -v`

        If you're using Node Version Manager to install Node, then Node Package Manager 6.11.3 will
        automatically be installed for you.

## Finding your project files

To access your project files, reach out to your team lead. If you're a team lead looking to generate a new project, reach out to your Mobify contact.

Now, let’s take a short tour of what’s inside your project folder. This is where you’ll spend most of your time in development. It contains all the code you’ll need to build a PWA.

In our documentation, we'll often use `<PROJECT_DIR>` to stand in for the actual project directory name.

## Installing dependencies

Now we need to download and install package dependencies using Node Package
Manager (npm) by running the following command from your project directory:

```bash
cd <PROJECT_DIR>
npm install --quiet
```

**Note:** It might take a few minutes before you see any activity in the terminal, so don’t cancel the process until it finishes. Thanks for your patience!

</Callout>

## Start your dev server

To start your local web server for local development, run the following command from your project directory:

```bash
npm run ssr
```

Now that the development server is running, you can open the PWA in a browser:
- Go to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

**Success!** You should now see the home page for the project scaffold application in your browser. You can stop the development server at any time by using the keyboard shortcut `Control-C`.

<Callout type="info">

**Note:** To preview a server-side rendered page, append the `?mobify_server_only` query string to the URL you'd like to preview. For example, you can test the server-side rendered version of `www.example.com` by visiting the URL `www.example.com?mobify_server_only`.
