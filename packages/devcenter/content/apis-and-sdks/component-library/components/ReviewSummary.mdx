A review summary typically appears on the product details page to display a summary of all the product reviews submitted by customers.

### Potential uses

-   Listed at the top of a set of Product reviews on the product details page.
-   On the product details page, to give the user a quick idea of other customers' satisfaction levels before choosing to read individual reviews.

### Accessibility

-   If the number of reviews is not a link, make that clear by removing any link color or underline attribute.

### Best practices

-   Most commonly the summary appears above a set of product reviews and is not interactive.
-   Sometimes a button may be used below the summary to "Read all reviews", which would open a modal window containing the reviews.
-   `ReviewsSummary` will typically contain a [`Rating`](Rating) and details of how many customers have reviewed the product.
-   A product thumbnail image is optional. It's useful when the review applies to a particular (colored) product option.
-   Some review summaries may include more detailed content, such as pros and cons.
