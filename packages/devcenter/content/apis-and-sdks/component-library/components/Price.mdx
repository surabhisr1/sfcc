### Potential uses

-   Within the product [Tile](Tile) component on a product listing page.
-   On a product details page, above or below the product name.
-   In the shopping cart to show the price of each item.
-   During checkout, wherever the user is presented a summary of the products being purchased.

### Accessibility

-   To communicate a previous price, make sure to use a strikethrough or the word "Was".
-   Don't rely only on color to differentiate a previous price from a sale price.
-   Long prices are easier to comprehend when separated by commas. Be sure to add a comma after every 3 characters. For example, $1000 should read $1,000.

### Best practices

-   If a website has sale pricing, use a neutral tone for the prices that are not on sale and a striking tone (typically red) to draw attention to sale items.
-   Sale pricing should always be accompanied by a previous price.
-   Differentiate previous prices using size, color and/or decoration, like a strikethrough.
-   Be clear with the dollar sign if the price is not in US dollars. For example, use CAD or CA\$ for prices in Canadian dollars.
-   Consider the spacing dedicated to pricing. Prices are controlled by the client and designers should be aware that some prices may vary extensively in number of characters.
-   European pricing may use commas instead of decimals.
