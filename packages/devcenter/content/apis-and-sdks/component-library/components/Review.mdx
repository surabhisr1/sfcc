### Potential uses

-   Listed within a set of product reviews on product detail pages.
-   Listed in a modal window from a product details page, after a user clicks to "Read reviews".

### Accessibility

-   Ensure the action buttons to give feedback on a review are clearly labelled as links by adding copy, icons, and/or using the site's link color.
-   If you're using thumbs up/thumbs down icons, ensure they're given text labels so that they're not confused with Facebook's Like button.

### Best practices

-   Be sure to check the contrast of text on background color to ensure it passes a11y guidelines. [Use this handy tool to guide you](http://www.contrastchecker.com).
-   A common pattern is for users to mark a review as helpful or not with a single tap.
-   Longer reviews may be expended by clicking on a "Read more" link.
-   Reviews will typically contain a [`Rating`](Rating), title, reviewer, reviewer location, description, and feedback buttons.
-   Some reviews will have multiple ratings for different product attributes.
-   Prioritize highlighting what's most useful to a shopper. Typically the review title and description is more important than the reviewer's name or location, so you should give the review title and description a larger prominence in text size and weight.
-   Reviews can be long or short. Consider restricting the copy and using a "Read More" link to preserve the balance of review tiles.
