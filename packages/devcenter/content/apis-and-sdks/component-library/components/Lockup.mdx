<div class="component-intro">

The `Lockup` component is used to stop the user from being able to scroll the page.
Normally, it should wrap around your main app container.
To lock the page, set the `locked` prop to true.
To unlock the page, set `locked` to false.

### Potential uses

-   Apply it to a page behind a modal to prevent the user from scrolling content behind the active window.
-   Use it on a page when content is loading in order to disable all other page actions.

### Accessibility

-   When setting the style for translucent layers, be aware of how the contrast can impact a user's cognitive load. If the opacity contrast is too fine, the main window may lose its focus.

### Best practices

-   When lockup is applied to a container, use a translucent layer so that the user doesn't expect to be able to tap on any elements.
-   Using a modal window above a translucent layer can be a good way of displaying content related to the task. With modals, a strong contrast is important to keep their focus on the active window.
