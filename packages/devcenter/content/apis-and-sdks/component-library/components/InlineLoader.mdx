Inline loaders are designed to tell the user that an action is being performed, without altering the state of the current page.

The `InlineLoader` component does not contain any actions of its own but is often placed on top of actions to indicate a loading, disabled state.

Related components: [LazyLoader](LazyLoader) and [SkeletonBlock](SkeletonBlock).

### Potential uses

-   Within a button to show that the button has been tapped and the corresponding action has been triggered.
-   On top of a disabled page state to provide a state between the action and the subsequent loading of a new page or state.
-   During initial app load, before content is available.
-   In between page loads, when transitioning from one page to another.
-   As an alternative to placeholders during lazy loading. Use them as a user scrolls down the screen, while new content loads.

### Accessibility

-   The inline loader doesn't correlate to any timeframe, so the animation should be clear that it's rotating continuously rather than having a beginning and an end.

### Best practices

-   Use inline loading instead of full page disablement.
-   Use an inline loader to replace button text while the button's action is loading.
-   Initiate the loader after the tapped state of an add to cart button, while the product is being added to cart.
-   On slow connections, a user may see this state for some time before the JS script has finished adding to cart. To account for this, the loading graphic should be continuous.
-   On fast connections, the `InlineLoder` may only flash for a split second. It's important to ensure the design is simple so that users are not confused when this situation occurs.
-   If you're using a spinner, use native components instead of a custom spinner.
-   If you're using a loader during page transitions, it's best to place the spinner on the non-loaded second screen while content loads.
-   When deciding whether to use spinners, throbbers, or placeholder images, consider their placement and function: throbbers typically have a landscape orientation and work well on buttons, placeholders excel at simulating products and cards, and spinners are optimal when they're used in the middle of the page.
