Icons communicate actions and give context to messaging through very simple imagery.

The `Icon` component renders an SVG that uses the chosen symbol from the SVG sprite present on the page.

Related component: [IconLabel](IconLabel).

### JavaScript import

```jsx
import Icon from 'progressive-web-sdk/dist/components/icon'
```

### SCSS import

```scss
@import 'node_modules/progressive-web-sdk/dist/components/icon/base';
```

### Props table

<PropsTable propMetaData={props.componentMetadata.childrenComponentProp} />

### Prerequisite: SVG icon sprite

In order for the `Icon` component to work, an SVG icon sprite must be loaded into the page where the `Icon` component is used. The icon sprite technique used is the same as [the one described by CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/svg-sprites-use-better-icon-fonts/),
combined with an [external SVG reference file](https://css-tricks.com/svg-use-with-external-reference-take-2/)
for caching. It's even possible to have multiple icon sprites (see the section below called "Example extra icon sprite").

```jsx
// It's recommended that the sprite value come from your state management 
// system, which will be updated after a successful Ajax request.
const externallyLoadedSpriteXml = this.props.sprite

// Add this to the app once in a high level place. This way the sprite will
// only be loaded once, and will be available across all pages and components.
<DangerousHTML html={externallyLoadedSpriteXml}>
    {(spriteString) => <div hidden dangerouslySetInnerHTML={spriteString} />}
</DangerousHTML>

// Once the above DangerousHTML is populated the sprite prop, Icon can be used
<Icon name="cart" />
```

### Available icons

All available icons are stored inside `<PROJECT_DIR>/app/static/svg/sprite-source/`. To use an icon from that directory, set the `name` prop of the icon to the filename without the `.svg` extension. For example, to use the icon called `zoom.svg`, you could use the following:

```jsx react-live=true
<Icon name="zoom" />
```

### Adding new icons

To add new icons to your project, place the SVGs inside the `<PROJECT_DIR>/app/static/svg/sprite-source/` directory. Then, run the command `npm run build-sprites`. This will optimize your SVGs and add them to the SVG icon sprite.

### Basic example

```jsx react-live=true
<Icon name="cart" title="Screen Readers read me, but not the next icon" />
```

**Icons** should be treated like images, with accessible titles for screen readers. That means the `title` attribute must be filled with useful text.

If no `title` is provided, the icon will be hidden from screen readers. In other words, it will be `aria-hidden: true`.

### Different sizes

Icons can take in a `size` prop. Common values include `small`, `medium` and
`large`.

```jsx react-live=true
<div>
    <Icon name="cart" size="small" />
    <Icon name="cart" size="medium" />
    <Icon name="cart" size="large" />
</div>
```

You can provide any string value into `size` and use its corresponding class to customize the appearance in any project. For example:

```jsx react-live=true
<div>
    <Icon name="cart" size="microscopic" />
    <Icon name="cart" size="gargantuan" />
    <Icon name="cart" size="colossal" />
</div>
```

### Extra icon sprite

It's possible to have multiple icon sprites at once by adding the additional icon sprites to your page. An SVG sprite's symbols should have unique prefixed IDs, such as `id="custom-blob"`. You can then use the Icon component's `prefix` and `name` props to reference your new icon sprite symbols.

```jsx react-live=true
<div>
    <div style={{display: 'none'}}>
        {/*
            Here we add the icon sprite via a JSX SVG component. We hide it in
            order to prevent it from visually rendering itself.
        */}
        <svg>
            {/*
                Notice that our id is `#custom-oval`, which we will reference
                using both the Icon component's `prefix` and `name` props.
            */}
            <symbol id="custom-oval">
                <g fill="#FF0000">
                    <circle id="Oval" cx="8" cy="8" r="8" />
                </g>
            </symbol>
        </svg>
    </div>

    {/*
        The prefix and name will combine to `#custom-oval`. Beware, if you don't
        declare a custom prefix, the Icon component assumes the prefix is `pw`,
        which is the default value
    */}
    <Icon prefix="custom" name="oval" />
</div>
```

</TabsPanel>
<TabsPanel title="Design" class="markdown">

### Potential uses

-   To symbolize actions when there is no space for words.
-   When there are many instances of the same action together, and repeating words would clutter the UI.
-   To reinforce a message. For example, using an error icon next to an error message.
-   Icons without labels are best suited to accompany simple actions or messages that are universally recognizable. These include arrows, tick/cross symbols, warnings, and plus/minus symbols.

### Accessibility

-   Don't assume that just because you understand an icon, everyone will. Use a label or support icon up with text if the message is not 100% clear.
-   Icons should not be smaller than 16px width or height to ensure they're legible.

### Best practices

-   Variable depending on the actions.
-   Only use icons without a label when the action is very clear.
-   Don't use icons when words will serve the purpose without cluttering the UI.
-   Keep your icons simple to ensure they're legible on small screens.
-   Use the SVG file format to keep the icons legible in all sizes.
-   Keep the vectors as simple as possible with minimal anchor points in order to reduce the file size.
-   Icons should be a single color so that the color can be easily defined in the CSS.
