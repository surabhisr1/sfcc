<div class="component-intro">

An _inline_ skeleton component which respects text properties such as line height and font size (which effectively becomes the height).

This type of skeleton component is most useful any time you need to mimic an inline piece of content. For example, this is common in the `Breadcrumbs` or `List` components.

### Potential uses

-   Used alongside [SkeletonText](SkeletonText) to mimic the visual hierarchy and structure of the loaded page.
-   Animation is commonly used to communicate to the user that something is in progress.
-   Use in place of inline loaders, progress bars, full screen spinners, or logos which indicate page load.
-   Example use cases: Facebook for iOS and Android, Slack app, Open Table app.

### Best practices

-   The key to a good skeleton state is to make it look similar enough to the loaded page that the user doesn't notice any change between the two states. Choose a skeleton layout that depicts less UI than the final page.
-   As you design the skeleton, consider the size of the eventual content. Skeleton states should reflect the most likely layout.
-   To ensure the skeleton feels like a quick transition between states, don't replace too many elements with a skeleton state. Only show elements that communicate the key functions of the page.
-   Use monotone when designing skeleton states. Too much color or contrast will attract too much attention.
-   Images can also be blurred or lazy loaded. For example, medium.com uses these techniques in addition to skeletons.
