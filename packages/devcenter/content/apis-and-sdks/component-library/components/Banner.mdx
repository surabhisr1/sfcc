Banners are used to display timely information in an attention-grabbing position and style.

Typically, banners will notify the user of the status of a previous action or display a state, such as offline mode.

### Potential uses

-   Displaying the availability of a promo code or other promotional messaging.
-   Notifying the user that they're browsing in offline mode.
-   Alerting the user that a form has _not_ been submitted due to errors.

### Accessibility

-   Be sure to check the contrast of text on background color to ensure it passes a11y guidelines. [Use this handy tool to guide you](http://www.contrastchecker.com).
-   Use green for success and red for failure, however do not rely on color alone. Be sure to include icons, and be clear in your language.

### Best practices

-   On tap, a user can follow a link to a url with further information.
-   On tap, an action can be set to open a modal which contains further information.
-   Usually there will be multiple variations of background color and icon.
-   Common places to position a banner include at the top of the page, below the header bar or fixed to the bottom of the viewport.
-   If a banner is being used for success/failure messaging, it should be attention-grabbing in color.
-   If a banner is used for promotional messaging site-wide, it should use a color which does not distract from the main actions on the page.
-   Banner messages should contain very few words and be clear. If there is more information required to explain the message, this should be accessible from another page or modal window.
