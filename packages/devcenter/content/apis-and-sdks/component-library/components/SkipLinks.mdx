<div class="component-intro">

The `SkipLinks` component allows you to provide faster navigation for users who interact with websites using keyboards, screen readers, or other technologies that don't rely on a mouse pointer.

The links specified within a `SkipLinks` component remain hidden until the user focuses on them using an interaction such as tabbing. At that point, they become visible.

### JavaScript import

```jsx
import SkipLinks from 'progressive-web-sdk/dist/components/skip-links'
```

### SCSS import

```scss
@import 'node_modules/progressive-web-sdk/dist/components/skip-links/base';
```

### Props table

<PropsTable propMetaData={props.componentMetadata.childrenComponentProp} />

### The target prop

The `target` prop is an ID in the form of a string which refers to a DOM element on the current page. It's used in an anchor tag's `href` to "jump" to the DOM element. For example, refer to `#app-navigation` or `#app-footer` in the next example below.

The `target` should point to an element that exists on the page. If there is no element on the page, it could result in an unexpected and confusing user experience for non-visual users, such as screen reader users.

### The label prop

The `label` prop is a text string that will display inside each individual anchor in the `SkipLinks`. This text should be human-readable so that any user agents can easily use it for simple navigation.

### Basic example

```jsx react-live=true
<div>
    <p>Press "Tab" until you see a link appear below this text!</p>
    <SkipLinks
        items={[
            {
                target: '#app-main',
                label: 'Skip to content'
            },
            {
                target: '#header-navigation',
                label: 'Skip to main navigation'
            },
            {
                target: '#app-footer',
                label: 'Skip to footer'
            }
        ]}
    />
</div>
```

</TabsPanel>

### Potential uses

-   As a "skip to content" action on all pages.

### Accessibility

-   This component is essential in order to conform with AA and AAA accessibility guidelines. Use it on every page for users to skip the global navigation.
-   Always consider non-touch users and the browsing experience for users who rely on the keyboard.

### Best practices

-   Typically the `SkipLinks` component is added to skip past the global navigational elements of a page.
-   `SkipLinks` is also used in forms, to skip past irrelevant content and tab to the next step in the flow.
-   This component can be used in any section where non-touch users have the need to skip over non-contextual content to continue with their flow.
