### Potential uses

- When a product presents various choice options that a shopper can/must select before making purchase.
- The PDP is the most common place for these options to exist.
- Product options may also appear in the shopping cart to allow item refinement before purchase.

### User Interactions

- Tap on the desired color from a list of available options using the [swatch](#!/Swatch) component.
- Tap on the desired size from a list of available options using the [swatch](#!/Swatch) component.
- Select an option using a native select menu.
- Toggle quantity up and down using the + and - icons of the stepper component.
- Select a text input and manually add a quantity.

### Accessibility

- Don't rely solely on color or opacity to differentiate available from unavailable selections. Alter the state by using something like a diagonal line to act as a strikethrough.
- Do not rely solely on a change to border color to mark the chosen option as colorblind users cannot differentiate. Consider increasing the width of the border to mark this change in state.

### Usage Tips & Best practices

- Avoid drop down menu selectors for style, size, and quantity selection whenever possible. Better to provide visual selectors for size and style and +/- buttons for quantity selection.
- If quantity is at minimum value (usually 1) use a disabled state for the - buttons, and vice-versa for maximum.
- The [feedback](#!/Feedback) component can be utilized to reinforce to the user that the chosen selection is in or out of stock.
- If certain swatches are not available do not hide the option from the user, apply a disabled state to the option instead.
- If certain product options cause the price to change, this new price should be reiterated in view next to the options and below the add to cart button.
