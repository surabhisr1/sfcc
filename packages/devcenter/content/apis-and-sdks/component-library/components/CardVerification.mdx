- A number pad should be defined as the contextual keyboard.\
- Normally only 2 images; AMEX and not-AMEX.
- Use SVGs for images in order to maintain legibility at all screen sizes.
- Restrict characters to only accept numbers in order to reduce errors.
- Restrict to a maximum of 3 digits.
- Image is best positioned on the right of the form field.

### Accessibility

- Ensure images are as legible as possible by using clear vector graphics.
