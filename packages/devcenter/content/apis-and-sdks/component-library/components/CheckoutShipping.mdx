### Usage Tips & Best practices

- Use a dedicated checkout header and footer, removing all links other than customer service information.
- Use [Banner](#!/Banner) component to inform the user of a detected email address.
- If a user signs in and they already have items in their cart from a previous session, use a dialogue modal to make them aware of this .
- Reduce number of fields to only those that are 100% necessary.
- If optional fields must be included, consider hiding these fields behind a reveal action using the view-more component.
- Use contextual keyboards where appropriate - email address zip code and phone number for example.
- Use input masks where applicable to ensure data is inputted correctly. For example, add brackets () and spaces to the phone number input field.
- Use best practice error messaging to ensure the erroneous field is highlighted and a note of the error appears next to it.
- Ensure a user can tab directly to the next field using the native keyboard.
- Consolidate first and last name form fields into a single full name field.
- Use what location features are available to pre-select the Country and if possible State/Province.
- Update field labels for State and ZIP code to Province and Postal Code if country is not United States.
- Inline validation should be utilized reduce post submit errors.
- Display the cost and delivery time (if available) to help user decide on shipping method.
- Use address lookup features (if available) to allow the quick completion of the rest of the form based on the first address line.
- Default logged in user’s saved addresses to the last used address.
- Ensure the browser or device’s back button navigates back to the cart.
