The `NavSlider` component is a helper component that's designed for customizing the slide-in and slide-out animations used when traversing items in the [Nav](Nav) component. You can use `NavSlider` to create fully-custom versions of the [NavHeader](NavHeader) and [NavMenu](NavMenu) components.

To take full advantage of the `NavSlider`, it should be used with the [TransitionGroup](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group) component.

Related components: [Nav](Nav), [NavHeader](NavHeader), [NavItem](NavItem), [NavMenu](NavMenu), and [NavSlider](NavSlider).

<div onClick={(e) => {e.stopPropagation()}}>
<Tabs activeIndex={0} className="devcenter">
<TabsPanel title="Code" onClick={(e) => {e.stopPropagation()}}>

### JavaScript import

```jsx
import NavSlider from 'progressive-web-sdk/dist/components/nav-slider'
```

### SCSS import

```scss
@import 'node_modules/progressive-web-sdk/dist/components/nav-slider/base';
```

### Props table

<PropsTable propMetaData={props.componentMetadata.childrenComponentProp} />

### Basic example

You may notice that our custom component in this example doesn't have any fancy animations. We'll get to that in an example further down!

```jsx static
/**
 * First we must import the third party
 * `TransitionGroup` component.
 */
const TransitionGroup = require('react-transition-group')

const CustomHeader = (props, context) => {
    /**
     * Notice that we use `expanded` and `expandedPath`
     * that we received from the `context`.
     */
    const {expanded, expandedPath} = context

    /**
     * While in this example we do not make use of
     * `props`, it is available if you need it.
     */
    return (
        <TransitionGroup>
            <NavSlider key={expandedPath}>
                <h2>
                    {expanded && expanded.title || ''}
                </h2>
            </NavSlider>
        </TransitionGroup>
    )
}

/**
 * We must ensure that `CustomHeader` inherits
 * `childContextTypes` from `Nav`, otherwise it will not
 * receive its `context`.
 */
 CustomHeader.contextTypes = Nav.childContextTypes


const initialState = {path: '/'}
const onPathChange = (path) => {
    setState({path: path})
}
const root = {
    title:"See My Custom Header?",
    path:"/",
    children: [{
        title:"Men's Clothing",
        path:"/mens-clothing/",
        children: [
            {title: "Jeans", path: "/mens-clothing/jeans/"},
            {title: "Polos", path: "/mens-clothing/polos/"},
            {title: "Shorts", path: "/mens-clothing/shorts/"}
        ]
    }]
}

<Nav
    root={root}
    path={state.path}
    onPathChange={onPathChange}
>
    <CustomHeader />
    <NavMenu />
</Nav>
```

By itself, `NavSlider` doesn't look like much. Instead, we must use it in combination with components like [TransitionGroup](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group). A common use case will be to use these two components together to create a custom [NavHeader](NavHeader) component, used in an instance of [Nav](Nav).

The example above shows how to create a custom component and apply it into a `Nav` component with a fully functional navigation tree. It's important to understand that a custom component must take both `props` and `context` as arguments in order to work correctly. These are automatically supplied by the `Nav` component, but must be enabled with the following:

```jsx static
const CustomHeader = (props, context) => {
    // define the custom header component here...
}
// Supply the context to our custom component...
CustomHeader.contextTypes = Nav.childContextTypes
```

</TabsPanel>
</Tabs>
</div>
