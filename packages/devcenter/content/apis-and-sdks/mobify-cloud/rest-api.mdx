<Callout type="warning">

**Important**: The Mobify Cloud API is now called The Managed Runtime API and the official
documentation has moved to the [Commerce Cloud Developer
Center](https://developer.commercecloud.com/s/api-details/a003k00000VzwSvAAJ/commerce-cloud-developer-centermanagedruntime).

## What does this mean for Mobify customers?

You can continue using the rebranded API without any disruption. All the endpoints are still accessible at `cloud.mobify.com` with your existing credentials and no breaking changes have been made.
