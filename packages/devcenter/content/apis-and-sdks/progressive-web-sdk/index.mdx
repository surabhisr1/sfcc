The Progressive Web SDK includes many of the core systems and tools in the Mobify Platform, including:

- A [component library](/apis-and-sdks/component-library) to build your storefront, written in React
- The [Analytics Integrations](/apis-and-sdks/progressive-web-sdk/analytics-integrations/overview) SDK for instrumenting analytics events
- A set of general-purpose utility functions written in JavaScript

The Progressive Web SDK is one of the core NPM packages that the Mobify projects depends on.

The SDK is distributed via NPM ([mobify-progressive-app-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mobify-progressive-app-sdk)).
