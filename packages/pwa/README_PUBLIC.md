# Progressive Web App

This package is your PWA. It supports server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side
rendering. You can develop both locally using the same codebase.

## Setup

If you haven't already, follow the setup steps in the README at the root of this
repository.

## Running Your PWA

You can run your PWA in either server-side or client-side rendering modes. The
default we recommend is server-side.

To start the Server Side Rendering (SSR) server, run:

```bash
npm run start
```

To start the PWA in client-side rendering Mode, ensure you've installed the Mobify tag
on your website and run:

```bash
npm run start:preview
```

Both commands print the URL you need to visit to see your running PWA in the terminal.

## Building Your PWA

Your project comes with a sample Commerce Integrations connector as well as examples
for home, product-listing and product description pages.

Our sample pages include links to sections in our documentation that show you how to
customize your PWA using our tools by including forms, modals, navigation, etc.
We recommend you run your PWA and explore the sample pages to get a feel for where
to begin.

For more context take a look at the other READMEs in this project as well as our
comprehensive documentation on the [Mobify DevCenter](https://dev.mobify.com/v1.x/).
