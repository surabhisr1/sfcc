## Usage Tips & Best Practices

- Users cannot go back to previous checkout steps and so the progress bar should not feature on this page.
- The page should offer clear indication of success such as clear copy and/or imagery.
- Content should include the order number and email address where they can find a receipt.
- If available, details of when the item will be delivered should be included.
- Account creation should be backed up by incentive copy, letting users know the benefits of signing up.
- Password should have hint text if the website has password requirements.
- Include a newsletter signup checkbox here if the website has this so that the customer can opt out.
- Include a success dialogue to tell the user their account creation was successful.
