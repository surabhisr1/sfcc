# Utility JavaScript Functions

We provide the following utility functions to help you write less code when
performing routine tasks, such as fetching URLs, parsing HTML, validating forms,
and normalizing user input. (Although these functions are written in ES6, they
will be transpiled to work in all the [browsers that are compatible with the
Mobify Platform](https://docs.mobify.com/platform/compatibility/).
