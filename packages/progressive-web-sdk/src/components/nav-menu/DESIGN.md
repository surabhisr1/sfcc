## Purpose

NavMenu is used specifically for links to product categories within the [Nav](#!/Nav) component.

## Appropriate Uses

- Within a navigation to hold a set of [NavItems](#!/NavItems).
- To group multiple levels of navigations and transition between them.

## User Interactions

- Tap on a NavItem to navigate to a CLP or PLP, or to transition to another set of nav items.
- Tap on a back button in the [NavHeader](#!/NavHeader) to transition back to the previous level.

## Usage Tips & Best Practices

- Typically a NavMenu is the most prominent action within the nav component and should have the most dedicated space.
- Ensure the NavMenu is not pushed down the page by any content above - a user should not have to scroll to get to the menu.
- See [NavItem](#!/NavItems) and [NavHeader](#!/NavHeader) for specific usage tips.

## Accessibility

- See [NavItem](#!/NavItems) and [NavHeader](#!/NavHeader) for specific accessibility guides.
