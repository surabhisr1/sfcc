*Symbol Path: action -> ActionList*

## Purpose

A collection of items all related to one another, grouped together in a vertical stack. Each item typically comprises of a line of text and/or icon with an associated action (optional).

## Appropriate Uses

- To provide the user with a number of navigation options to categories and sub-categories within the site.
- Typically used on the home page to contain category and sub-category navigation.
- Graphic elements representing each category are often included.

## User Interactions

- User taps a visual or text link to navigate to the corresponding page.

## Usage Tips & Best Practices

- Text should be included on visual element links to improve comprehension of the element. Text should also appear towards the top of the visual element so that users scrolling down the page can clearly read the text as they uncover the image link.
- Clearly separate any unrelated lists appearing in the same space using dividers or negative space.

## Accessibility

- Ensure ListTiles are separated with enough space to conform to minimum tap target requirements (usually 44px).
