*Symbol Path: icons -> Icon*

## Purpose

Icons communicate actions and give context to messaging through very simple imagery.

## Appropriate Uses

- To symbolize actions where there is no space for words.
- Where there are many of the same action together, and repeating words would clutter the UI.
- To reinforce a message and make it clearer at a glance (e.g. use of an error icon next to an error message).
- Icons without labels are best suited to simple actions or messages that are universally recognizable: arrows, tick/cross, warning, plus/minus.

## User Interactions

- Variable depending on the actions.

## Usage Tips & Best Practices

- Icons should only be used without a label where the action is completely clear.
- Do not use icons where words will serve just as well without cluttering the UI.
- Keep your icons simple to ensure readability on the small screen.
- Use SVGs to keep the icons legible at all sizes.
- Keep the vectors as simple as possible with minimal anchor points in order to keep the file size down.
- Icons should be a single color so that the color can be easily defined in the CSS.

## Accessibility

- Do not assume that just because you understand an icon, everyone will. Use a label or back your icon up with text if the message is not 100% clear.
- Icons should not be smaller than 16px width or height to ensure legibility.
