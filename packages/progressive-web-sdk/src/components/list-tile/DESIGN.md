*Symbol Path: action -> ActionList*

## Purpose

Items comprising of a line of text and/or icon with an associated action (optional), designed to group together in a vertical stack to form a [list](#!/List).

## Appropriate Uses

- To provide the user with a number of navigation options to categories and sub-categories within the site.
- Typically used on the home page to contain category and sub-category navigation.
- Graphic elements representing each category are often included.

## User Interactions

- User taps a visual or text link to navigate to the corresponding page.

## Usage Tips & Best Practices

- Typically the graphic element is placed to the left of the text element so as to better connect the two elements on wider screen widths.

## Accessibility

- Ensure ListTiles are separated with enough space to conform to minimum tap target requirements (usually 44px).
- Do not rely solely on icons/imagery to describe the section, always support graphical elements with text.
