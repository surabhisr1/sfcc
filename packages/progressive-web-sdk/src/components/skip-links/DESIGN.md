# Design

## Purpose

SkipLinks are used to provide users with the ability to tab past navigational items straight to the content. They are an accessibility requirement that both designers and developers should be aware of and implement consistently.

## Appropriate Uses

- As a 'skip to content' action on all pages.

## User Interactions

- User uses the tab button on their native keyboard to skip past content.

## Usage Tips & Best Practices

- Typically the SkipLinks component is added to skip past the global navigational elements of a page.
- Also used in forms to skip past irrelevant content and tab to the next step in the flow.
- This component can be used in any section where non-touch users have the need to skip over non-contextual content to continue with their flow.

## Accessibility

- This component is essential at conforming to AA and AAA accessibility guidelines, use it on every page to skip the global navigation.
- Always consider non-touch users and the browsing experience when using only the keyboard.
