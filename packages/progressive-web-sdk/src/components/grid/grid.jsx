/**

 * @deprecated ðŸš¨ since version 1.2
 *
 * Instead of using the Grid component, you can use the Susy library. Read our
 * tutorial, [Creating Responsive Layout Grids With
 * Susy](../guides/responsive-grid/).
 *

 *
 * ## Introduction
 *
 * Related component:
 *
 * * [GridSpan](#!/GridSpan)
 *
 * `Grid` is a wrapper component for preparing grid layouts. It acts as the
 * initial foundation in which the GridSpan component may be used to define
 * layouts.
 *
 * Our grid framework of choice is
 * [Susy](http://susydocs.oddbird.net/en/latest/) and all of Grid's and
 * GridSpan's behaviors are defined with the Susy mixins.
 *
 * @example ./DESIGN.md
