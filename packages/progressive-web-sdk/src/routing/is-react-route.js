/**
 * HACK:
 *
 * For client-side apps the value of ORIGIN can be determined by looking at
 * window.location. During SSR rendering it can't and the correct value isn't even
 * known before the SSR server starts. For that reason, when rendering server-side,
 * we set ORIGIN to undefined and wait for the server to start, which is expected to
 * set the correct value here.
 *
 * This mutable global is difficult to work with in tests, etc. but we need to
 * maintain it for backwards compatibility â€“ ORIGIN has always been exported, it is
 * in use by components and, potentially, end-user code.
