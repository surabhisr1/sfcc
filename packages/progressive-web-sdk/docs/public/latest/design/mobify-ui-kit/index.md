The Mobify UI Kit provides designers with a head start to tackling the design of a Mobify PWA, AMP, or native app project. It helps you quickly create mockups for your project with a series of Sketch files that offer adaptable and reusable UI elements. The Kit will expedite your design work for a Mobify Platform project:

- The UI Kit has been built to match with Mobifyâ€™s SDK components, making it easy for developers to transform your designs into code.
- UI elements in the Kit provide best practice mobile commerce templates, specifically designed for PWA, AMP, and native app experiences.

By reducing the work involved in building all these components from scratch, the UI Kit allows designers to focus more attention on the overall visual design, and on more complex interaction problems. You can start off with a performant design and customize it to suit your project.
