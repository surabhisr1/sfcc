## Essential skills

You’ll need intermediate knowledge of JavaScript to successfully onboard with the Mobify Platform. Before diving in, it’s a good time to get familiar with:

- Writing modern JavaScript in ECMAScript 2015 (also known as ES6)
- Using Node and Node Package Manager to install and manage JavaScript
  dependencies
- Building React components to render user interfaces
- Using version control systems like Git to store your code

In the sections below, we’ll introduce you to a few learning resources that can help you ramp up on the tools and technologies you’ll be using with the Mobify Platform. Grab a coffee, it’s time to get learning!

## Git and GitHub

Even if you won’t be using Git and Github to manage your source code during
development, you will need to use them if you plan on attending a training
session with Mobify or if you need to review any of Mobify's source code.

- [Git For Humans](https://abookapart.com/products/git-for-humans): book-length
  introduction to Git aimed at new users.
- [GitHub Guides: Hello
  World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/): explains the basics of using GitHub.
- [Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent](https://help.github.com/en/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent):
  essential configuration step for anyone pushing code to a GitHub repository.

## JavaScript and ES6

Most of the coding you’ll be doing with Mobify PWAs will be in JavaScript. You will be using many new language features included in the ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) standard.

- [A Re-Introduction To JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript):
  good reference to review the basic language features. If you you haven’t coded in JavaScript recently, this will be a good refresher.
- [ES6 In Depth: An Introduction](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/04/es6-in-depth-an-introduction/):
  briefly summarizes how (and why) ES6 emerged as a standard.
- [Learn ES6 (ECMAScript 2015)](https://egghead.io/courses/learn-es6-ecmascript-2015): short video
  walkthroughs of new language features. Highly recommended for all developers!
- [Understanding ECMAScript 6](https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read):
  book-length reference on ES6 that you can read online for free.

## React and Redux

We use these two foundational technologies to build user interface components and manage the flow of data in our applications.

- [React Github](https://reactjs.org/): a great starting place for React. Here, Facebook defines what React is and shows what their technology can do using simple code examples.
- [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) and [React
  Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html): more in-depth resources from Facebook. Be aware that the tutorial can take a long time to complete, and it covers how to manually manage your application’s state—a task that is best left to Redux.
- [Redux Docs](https://redux.js.org/): official Redux documentation. The basics covers a simple to-do list application as an example of how the different parts of Redux work together.
- [Getting Started With Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux): this is a
  series of videos narrated by Dan Abramov, the creator of Redux. Abramov will walk you through the to-do list example from the official Redux Docs. As a caution, some of the videos may overwhelm junior developers as they explore different architectural approaches.
- [Redux Examples](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/blob/master/docs/introduction/Examples.md): a collection of simple examples that illustrate how React and Redux work together. Interactive versions of most examples are provided using CodeSandbox.
- [Redux Tutorial from François Bonnefont](https://github.com/happypoulp/redux-tutorial): teaches you the
  basics of React and Redux through annotated source code.
- [React-Redux Tutorial From Vincent Audebert](https://github.com/springload/react-redux-exercise): practice using
  React and Redux together with three different exercises. Good luck cheating: the author states that “solutions are encoded in base64 so you don’t get too tempted to look at them directly.”
