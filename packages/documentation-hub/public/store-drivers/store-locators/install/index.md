Installing your locator is as easy as adding a few lines of code to your page.

Start by clicking SETTINGS -> INSTALL from the dashboard. This will bring you to the installation with the 3 easy steps and the specific script needed for your business's locator

The installation dynamically pulls your locator onto the page. Which means any changes you make through the dashboard to configure your locator in the future, will automatically be updated on your locator without the need to submit new code or re-install.
