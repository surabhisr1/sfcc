To get the most out of Smart Content:

-   Image assets uploaded when creating a campaign must be in JPG, PNG, or GIF format.
-   Image assets should be **no larger than 1MB, and ideally much smaller**. It is also a good idea to optimize the image using [lossless compression](https://tinypng.com).
-   Always preview your Smart Content campaign to see how it will display on your website or app **before publishing**.
