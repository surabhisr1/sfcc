We get it!  We understand that there will be times when you want to stop receiving push notifications for a website or app.  The guide below will walk you through the steps to opt-out from all supported browsers and platforms.

## Background
When a person subscribes to receive web push notifications, it is the web browser that enables this feature.  It is from the browser where the shopper must disable, or opt out, of web push notifications.

Similarly in an app, when a person subscribes to receive app push notifications, it is the device itself that enables this feature.  It is from the device's settings where the shopper must disable app push notifications.

Let's get started.
