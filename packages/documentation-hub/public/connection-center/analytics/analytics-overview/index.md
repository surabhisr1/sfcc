## Engagement Metrics

### Messages Sent
The total number of messages sent in the selected time range to a subscriber base.
> Example: If 2 distinct messages are sent to 30,000 subscribers each, the total messages sent = 60,000

### Messages Displayed
The total number of all messages displayed on any device.
> Example: If 2 distinct messages are sent to 30,000 subscribers each, and 20,000 are displayed per message, the total messages displayed = 40,000

### Messages Clicked
The number of users that have clicked on a message.
> Note: This would correspond to the Webpush Users (Clickers) in your Web Push GA dashboard

### Message Click Through Rate
The number of messages clicked divided by the number of messages displayed.
> Example: If there are 5,000 messages clicked out of 20,000 messages displayed, the click through rate would be 5,000 divided by 20,000 = 0.25 (or 25%)
