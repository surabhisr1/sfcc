In order to test the prototype in real life scenarios, the Beta version will be researched in the form of a 4 week diary study.

We recommend participants record feedback a minimum of once every other day.

Participants are welcome to document feedback however works best for them, alternatively there is a feedback form that can help outline the recommended feedback structure. Access this form any time from the following link:

## Tips for providing feedback

The goal of the research study is to understand where the tool is useful in the day to day job of the target persona, and where it doesnâ€™t provide value. We feel like the tool can prove useful in several situations, these include:

- Tracking daily progress
- Going back in time to check performance at a particular selling period
- Understanding which days of the week or month mobile shoppers are most active
- Discovering which metrics regularly influence peaks and troughs

We'd like to know what the goal of the participant was when accessing the dashboard and if/how the dashboard helped achieving that goal.
